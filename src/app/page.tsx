                development of two major SaaS applications (server and app
                monitoring), leveraging my expertise in both frontend and
                backend technologies.
              </p>
              <h6>SaaS Application using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React.JS</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Developed and implemented new features across both the backend
                  and frontend.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Introduced React components into a Rails environment to
                  enhance user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensured seamless integration of new functionalities while
                  maintaining high performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provided comprehensive support and gathered user feedback.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h6>SaaS Application using Ruby, React.JS, and Microservices</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Focused primarily on frontend development with React.JS.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Occasionally worked on backend microservices written in Ruby
                  and Go.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contributed to maintaining and enhancing a legacy part of the
                  application written in CoffeeScript.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Throughout these projects, I utilized a variety of technologies,
                including React.JS, Ruby, GraphQL, CoffeeScript, Redux, gRPC,
                Docker and SemanticUI. My role involved not only hands-on
                development but also collaborating with cross-functional teams
                to ensure the delivery of high-quality software solutions.

              A personal project where I explored and tested various AI-powered
              development tools and technologies while building a Eurovision
              Song Contest data visualization platform. This project served as a
              testing ground for modern AI coding assistants, MCP tools, and
              cloud services.
            </p>

            <h6>Key Focus Areas:</h6>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Experimented with AI coding tools including Vibe Coding, MCP
                (Model Context Protocol), Cursor Agent, and Anthropic AI for
                enhanced development workflow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Utilized MCP tools including Supabase MCP and Perplexity MCP for
                seamless integration with backend services and AI-powered
                research capabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Implemented AI task management workflows using AI task manager
                and PRD (Product Requirements Document) generation for project
                planning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built data visualization features to display Eurovision voting
                patterns, country performance trends, and contest statistics.
              </li>
              <li>
                Integrated Supabase for backend services, database management,
                and real-time data handling.
              </li>

            In my free time, I enjoy traveling to new destinations, playing
            basketball, and expressing my creativity through drawing. These
            activities help me stay active, explore different cultures, and
            unwind.
