                monitoring), leveraging my expertise in both frontend and
                backend technologies.
              </p>
              <h6>SaaS Application using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and React.JS</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Developed and implemented new features across both the backend
                  and frontend.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Introduced React components into a Rails environment to
                  enhance user experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ensured seamless integration of new functionalities while
                  maintaining high performance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Provided comprehensive support and gathered user feedback.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h6>SaaS Application using Ruby, React.JS, and Microservices</h6>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Focused primarily on frontend development with React.JS.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Occasionally worked on backend microservices written in Ruby
                  and Go.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Contributed to maintaining and enhancing a legacy part of the
                  application written in CoffeeScript.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Throughout these projects, I utilized a variety of technologies,
                including React.JS, Ruby, GraphQL, CoffeeScript, Redux, gRPC,
                Docker and SemanticUI. My role involved not only hands-on
                development but also collaborating with cross-functional teams
                to ensure the delivery of high-quality software solutions.
